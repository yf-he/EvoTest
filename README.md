To use the openrouter API, create a file called ".env" with 1 line containing your openrouter key (from https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys):

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

When using OpenAI models through openrouter, it may require you to do some additional steps on the OpenRouter website (not sure; I had to set it up but not sure if you have to do it individually too). If so, you can set it up.
